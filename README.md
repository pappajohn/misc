Liverpool_notebook is a companion to this blog on the probability of drawing a pair in an 11-card hand from two 52-card decks https://apappajohn.wordpress.com/  

Risk_Outcome_Simulator_v2 is meant to help you determine the probability of winning a battle in Risk; note the attacking_units refers to the # of units that leave a territory (e.g., if territory A has 3 units, it can only attack territory B with up to 2 units as defined in the script. A win occurs when there are no opposing units left to defend; a loss occurs when there are no attacking units left)
